## ðŸ“– About the project
In this project, I created an interactive program through an easy and intuitive menu. The menu is composed of conditionals and loops, with basic information validation. After each input, the program automatically updates the information. <br>
I chose the C language for this project as I wanted to practice it and, not only that, but also to employ a lower-level language for the logic and programming challenges of the DIO 'PotÃªncia Tech iFood - Programming from Scratch' bootcamp."
